# Behavioral design patterns
## State pattern

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.

```
The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.
```

#### Usage of the pattern in Java

#### Usage examples: 

The State pattern is commonly used in Java to convert massive switch-base state machines into the objects.

Here are some examples of the State pattern in core Java libraries:

```
javax.faces.lifecycle.LifeCycle#execute() (controlled by the FacesServlet: behavior is dependent on current phase (state) of JSF lifecycle)
```

#### Identification: 

State pattern can be recognized by methods that change their behavior depending on the objectsâ€™ state, controlled externally.
