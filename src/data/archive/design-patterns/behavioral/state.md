# Behavioural design patterns
## Chain of Responsibilities pattern

State is a behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.


```
The pattern extracts state-related behaviors into separate state classes and forces the original object to delegate the work to an instance of these classes, instead of acting on its own.
```
